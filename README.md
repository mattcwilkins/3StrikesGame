Three Strikes Game

This game uses player performance statistics from real life MLB players in real life MLB games to assign points to the participants of the game—known as “3 Strikers.”
The game is broken into 18 scoring periods.

A scoring period starts on each Friday of the game season and ends on the following Tuesday (Games that start on Tuesday evening but end early Wednesday morning CST will be counted).

Before each scoring period, every 3 Striker can pick 1 player at each the following positions from any MLB team roster:
1st Base:
2nd Base:
3rd Base:
Short Stop:
Outfield (just 1 player):
Team Defense: Pick any 1 team
OPTIONAL :
       Any Catcher can be used at any INFIELD position at any time.
       Any DH can be used in the OUTFIELD position at any time.
       
Once you pick a player/defense, you cannot pick that player or defense again for the rest of the game.

Picked players will score points based on their real-life performances in the first 3 games that they have a plate appearance in within that scoring period. Only games that are played completely within scoring period will be counted. That means that any game that started before the Friday of the scoring period or that ends after the Tuesday of the scoring period will be disregarded.

Any player can be picked up to the start of that player's first plate appearance starting on or after the Friday of the scoring period. If a 3 Striker is late and picks a player who has already had one or more plate appearances in the scoring period, that player will get 0 points for all games that have started or have been completed in the scoring period. The player may still score any points accumulated in the remaining 1 or 2 games within the scoring period that haven't started yet. If a 3 Striker picks a Defense after that team has started one or more games in the scoring period, that team will be marked as having given up 8 runs for each game that has started or been completed.

All players must be picked from the provided drop-down list. The list is the best possible update MLB's position list. The list may be updated throughout the year. If a player moves to a new position list, he will be removed from the old position list. A player who has been picked at one position may not be picked again because he changed positions.

Based on your picks' actual results for the weekend series each week, you will get a score. That score will be calculated as follows:
Players picked at 1st Base, 2nd Base, 3rd Base, SS, and OF will score points for that equal their Total Bases, plus Walks and Hit by Pitches.
Total bases is number bases reached through hits so that a single will count for 1 point, a double counts as 2 points, and so on. Each Walk and Hit by Pitch will count for a single point.

The team you pick for your Defense will score 25 points minus the number of runs allowed over that team’s first three games within the scoring period. The lowest allowable Defense score for a single scoring period will be 0 even if that Defense allows more than 25 runs in the three applicable games.
Before the start of each scoring period, the number of strikes that will be distributed at the end of the scoring period will be announced. After all the 3 Strikers’ scores are added up at the end of the scoring period, the 3 Striker(s) who finish with the lowest overall score for that scoring period will be given strikes starting at the lowest score and moving up to the next lowest score until all of the strikes for that scoring period have been distributed. When you get 3 strikes over the course the season, you are eliminated from the game and moved to the Loser’s Pool.

The tie-breaker to determine who gets a strike will be (in this order):
1. Total score over the course the whole season
2. Team/defense score for that week
3. Outfielder score that week
4. If all of the above factors still result in a tie, all tied players get a strike

Any player who does not enter a roster will get an automatic score of 1 for the scoring period AND will have replacement players and a replacement Defense assigned for the scoring period following the same guidelines for repeated players above.

Any participant who goes 3 full weeks without entering a roster will be eliminated from all aspects the game.
